## Generating and Uploading Images to S3 with Golang/Lambda
#### XXX XX/XX/19

---

I love to write programs that generate interesting pictures. I will always get a warm
tingly feeling when the output something that I wrote surprises me.
One way to achieve this is to recursively draw lines according to some rules. My first real
attempt at this was 4 years ago, in the early days of Rust. Back then there wasn't fully fledged
graphics library for Rust. Instead there was an image library where you could create an array,
which you could fill with pixel structs and then export it as a png. And no, it wasn't
a 2D array, you had to transform (x,y) coordinates into indexes for a 1D array. Fun! So I
implemented a function to draw a line, and a function to draw a circle, and then recursively
called them - [source](https://github.com/knoebber/Rustals/blob/master/src/main.rs).
Here's a few of my favorites images that it generated:

<div id="image-gallery">
  <div class="expandable-image">
    <input type="checkbox" id="circle-toggle" class="toggle" />
    <label for="circle-toggle">circles<img src="images/rustal_circle.png"  alt="circle"></label>
  </div>
  <div class="expandable-image">
    <input type="checkbox" id="shell-toggle" class="toggle" />
    <label for="shell-toggle">shell<img src="images/rustal_shell.png"  alt="shell"></label>
  </div>
  <div class="expandable-image">
    <input type="checkbox" id="tree-toggle" class="toggle" />
    <label for="tree-toggle">tree<img src="images/rustal_rand_tree.png"  alt="tree"></label>
  </div>
  <div class="expandable-image">
    <input type="checkbox" id="square-toggle" class="toggle" />
    <label for="square-toggle">squares<img src="images/rustal_square.png"  alt="square"></label>
  </div>
</div>

Previously my website had an app called trees. It let the user create tree images by
specifying different parameters:

* depth: how many times to recursively draws more branches
* branches: 2 for a binary tree, 3 for a ternary tree, etc
* length: how long in pixels each branch should be
* angle: the angle that a new branch is drawn from its parent

Here's an example of a [result](../tree_d-4_b-5_l-200_a-25.png) and here's the
[source](https://github.com/knoebber/personal-website/tree/e78e112376580580bbf8d36bf02cd71ccdcc9feb/trees).
This worked by using php to call a python program that used pygame to generate the image.
Sadly, when I moved my website over to be [statically hosted](5.html), I did not reimplement it
and so it died.

### The Resurrection

Armed with my new knowledge from [making an api for a static page with lambda](6.html), and writing
in Go for my current job, I jumped into making a new and improved image generator. The first step
was to create a Go program that could generate and save an image. I decided to use the [Go Graphics](https://github.com/fogleman/gg)
library.

#### Drawing and saving a simple image in go

    :::go
    package main

    import "github.com/fogleman/gg"

    func main() {
        // gg - Go Graphics.
        c := gg.NewContext(1000, 1000)
        c.DrawCircle(400, 400, 400)
        c.SetRGB(0, 0, 0)
        c.Fill()
        c.SavePNG("circle.png")
    }

So I could save an image of a circle to my local file system. Great. The immediate problem I saw
was that I wouldn't be able to use the `SavePNG` method in lambda, as it has no filesystem. Instead,
it would have to send the image to the S3 bucket that my website is hosted on. To solve this, I
started looking through the godocs for `gg` and `aws-sdk-go`. I needed to find the type
that an S3 bucket expected to receive as the body of its upload, and then find how to convert an
image from the `go graphics` library into this type. This is where Go shines over the other options
for lambda handlers - it is a typed language vs the untyped Python and Nodejs. I could find a 
solution by looking at types, and be confident that if compiled it would work. Debugging by 
reading compiler errors is a great time saver over waiting for runtime failure.

I found that I would need to use the `"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"` package to call
`putObject`. This method takes a `*PutObjectInput` as its only parameter. This lets you
specify all sorts of [things](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/#PutObjectInput),
but has a few required attributes:

* Bucket - the name of the S3 bucket
* Body - the data to be uploaded
* Key - the name for the data in the bucket (the key of this page is "posts/7.html")

I would have to set `Body` to the image that I generated. It's type is a `io.ReadSeeker`. 
Next I looked in the `go graphics` package for some methods that might return a type that would work
with this. I found the `EncodePNG` method that can be called on the context. It has an `io.Writer` 
type as its parameter. It's important to note here that the `io` types cannot be instantiated, 
instead they are interfaces that other structs can implement through duck typing. If you are 
familiar with Java, then `abstract class` or `interface` is similar - except in Go you don't need 
to tell the compiler that a class `extends` or `implements`, it's done automatically. The actual 
structs that I used are from the golang `"bytes"` package - which implements the `io` reading and 
writing functionality. So I would write the bytes from the image in the `gg`  context, and then 
read them into the S3 upload struct. Here's a working example of creating an image with `gg` and then
uploading it to a bucket:

    :::go
    package main

    import (
      "bytes"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
      "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"
      "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
      "github.com/fogleman/gg"
    )

    func draw() (buffer *bytes.Buffer, err error) {
      c := gg.NewContext(1000, 1000)
      // Create the image.
      c.SetRGB(200,200, 0)
      c.DrawCircle(400, 400, 400)
      c.Fill()
      // Write the bytes from the image in the context to a buffer.
      buffer = new(bytes.Buffer)
      if err = c.EncodePNG(buffer); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("failed to encode png %s",err.Error())
      }
      return
    }

    func main() {
      buffer, err := draw()
      if err != nil {
        return
      }

      // Create a S3 client
      session := session.Must(session.NewSession(&aws.Config{
        Region: aws.String("us-west-2"),
      }))
      svc := s3.New(session)

      // Read the bytes from the byte buffer that contains the image.
      reader := bytes.NewReader(buffer.Bytes())
      putInput := s3.PutObjectInput{
        Bucket: aws.String("nicolasknoebber.com"),
        Body:   reader,
        Key:    aws.String("test_upload.png"),
      }
      _, err := svc.PutObject(&putInput)
      if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err.Error())
      }
    }


[It Worked!](../test_upload.png). But wait, there's no access key here. Does this mean anyone can
copy this code onto their machine and start uploading things to my bucket? This would be possible 
if I set my bucket to have write permissions by everyone. But I don't. So how then does this code 
know its me? The secret is in the `session` variable - somewhere in the `aws/session` package it 
is getting the access key that I set when I ran `aws configure` in my terminal.
