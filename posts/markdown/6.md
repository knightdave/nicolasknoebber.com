## adding a serverless commenting system to my blog
#### Tue 07/31/18

Serverless web technologies are awesome. No longer do we need to pay for servers to spin 24/hours a day to listen for a request
that may never come. Instead we can pay per request, and with a little JavaScript, make the users computer do the bulk of the work! Excellent.

My goal for this post is to implement a commenting system for this blog. The user experience should be as follows:

* an input for their name
* a text area for the comment body
* a reCAPTCHA to solve
* a button to submit

After submitting a script will send out an AJAX request and the page will be updated to show the new comment, which will consist of a date, name, and body.

The back-end will handle everything in-between the user hitting submit and the page updating. I'll use the following AWS technologies for this:

* Lambda
* API Gateway
* DynamoDB

One problem with this approach is that there can't be any preprocessing on page load. If I were using the classic LAMP stack, I might do something
like this to fetch and display all the comments:

    <div id="comments">
      <?php
        $result = $mysqli->query("SELECT `date`, `name`,`body` FROM comments");
        while($obj = $result->fetch_object())
          echo make_comment($obj);
      ?>
    </div>

The advantage with this approach is that all the work is done on the server before the page is loaded. To achieve the same thing with a serverless setup , I'll have to rely on a script
to retrieve and insert the comments into the DOM *after* the page has loaded. This two obvious disadvantages:

* Users with scripts turned off will not be able to see comments
* The page will take longer to fully load

The advantage is that no longer will I have to pay for a server to wait nonstop for that request to run the above PHP code, instead I'll only have to pay for the individual requests that occur, and the
users web browsers can do the rest of the work. Great!

I will start this project with the front end and work my way back from there. The most obvious place to start is the actual form element that will let users submit comments. I'll make
this with JavaScript , as it won't work without it.
