## Taking a Break From Work

About a month ago I finished my contract work doing LAMP stack web development at FabPro1. Since then I've been spending some time catching
up on other parts of my life. I went to back to Grinnell to see graduation. It was a bit weird being back - college feels
like a different life now. It's crazy that I was living there after college for a bit. I like it , but the weather volatility
makes it not feasible for the lifestyle that I want. Mostly it comes down to being able to spend time outside year round, and the
brutal winters don't allow that.

Other than that I've been finishing up the [d36](http://ama-d36.org) spring cross country season. This is the first time that
I've entered all the races, and its been a big learning experience. It's a really crazy sport. Everyone rides their
own machine, the gun shoots, and its free for all until you cross the line at the end. People might crash into you, you
could fly off a cliff of no return, your bike could suffer mechanical failure, you could break your own body , etc. It's all about finishing
the race in one piece without damages. Getting a good placing is nice too. I've definitely been improving as the season has gone on. 
I've learned that the preparing is incredibly important. Eating and hydrating before , bringing extra supplies in a pack, and having the bike tuned right
are all musts. Besides that the most important thing I've learned is that being smooth and consistent is much more important than just trying for raw speed. The first lap is for learning
the course, and the following are all about optimizing. Finding the lines that take less energy for you , remembering safe places to pass, and then being able to remember and execute is key.

I finished the season with 3 first places in class. The first two from the Sawmill 2 day enduro, which gave points for cross country as well, and the final at Leoni Meadows, which was the last race.
Overall I finished first place in points for C 250 4Stk, which I am definitely happy about!

With the racing season over and having no current work the idea of travelling has popped into my head. My grandparents
are always telling me, "You're young, see the world!", so I figure I should listen to their wisdom.
So when a Canadian sailboat was blown into my home harbor, and their crew jumped ship because it was "too rough", I knew what I had to do. The captain and his
wife needed someone to help them sail south. I volunteered knowing nothing about sailing , but eager to learn. I would be working for food, board,
sailing lessons, and a ticket to Mexico.

Pretty good deal!

The captain, Michael, and his vessal, Emma.
