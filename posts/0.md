## about me
#### Sat 07/21/18
Hi! Iâ€™m a  computer science major who is interested in a whole lot of
stuff. I grew up in a small town in Northern Californian coast called Mendocino, and graduated
from [Grinnell College](https://grinnell.edu "grinnell") in 2018.

On the computer science side I am currently interested in the following topics:

* GNU/Linux
* serverless web development
* data visualization
* emergent algorithms and fractals
* privacy
* decentralized networks
* cryptocurrency and blockchain technology

Outside of computers I enjoy long distance running, racing my dirtbike, reading any kind of book,
playing any kind of game (Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo GameCube!), baking bread,
writing, and traveling.

In general I am open to most things, and try to take any idea into consideration.
So if you want to connect with me, work with me, or share any kind of idea, please email me!
