  Hi! I’m a twenty something year old computer science major who is interested in a whole lot of
 stuff. I grew up in a small town on the Northern Californian coast called Mendocino, and am
currently attending Grinnell College in Iowa.

  I’m not quite sure what I’m going to do when I graduate this spring, but right now I
think that I would like to do something in the computer industry, though what I’m not quite sure. Recently I have become really interested in servers and cloud virtualization,
which seems like something I would like to make a career out of.
Some other topics in computer science that really interest me are peer-to-peer networks,
data visualization, and cryptocurrency.

  But I’m really open to what I want to do. Other things that would make me happy include
wandering the world, playing Super Smash Brothers Melee, teaching, racing motorcycles,
running, hiking, writing novels, or any kind of adventure in general.

But I am very open to most things, and try to take any idea into consideration.
So if you want to connect with me, work with me, or share any kind of idea, please email me!
