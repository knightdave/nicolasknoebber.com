<h2>Sailing to Ensenada</h2>
<h4>Mon 06/25/18</h4>
<p>My trip has been going well thus far. I have been in Ensenada for the last 10 days ,
which has been much nicer than I thought it would be. The people are so kind , and the food is great!
I have been staying on the boat with the captain and his wife in a marina on the main strip of town.</p>
<p>It is quite a touristy area, but I have been surprised to find that there are much more
Mexican tourists than Americans. The tourist area of the town is well marked - all the sidewalks are
kept clean, there are security guards, water fountains that kids play in , live music ,
food stands, a larger than life Mexican flag, boat rides, a train that runs up and down, and
stunning views of the port.  Everyday it fills to the brim with Mexican families and their kids
frolicking about. Really nice to see.</p>
<p>That is until one of the the Carnival cruise ships docks for the day.
Then the town crawls with white people for about 6 hours , until the ship honks its horn
before dark and they all are gone in an eye blink - whereupon it returns to the local scene.
It makes me feel almost like a local compared to the rest of the US visitors.</p>
<p>I have been running for an hour every morning , which has been good for me.
I even joined a 6k race the other day! It was amazing how many people entered.
I didn't come in first, but I definitely should of won the award for
'tallest racer' . There must have been almost a thousand people there.
It was free to enter and I got a free shirt. Pretty good deal.</p>

<p>I have been thinking a lot about running lately (sparked by an excellent book that I read,
'Born to Run') and I want to get into longer distances. First I need to relearn how to run in a
more efficient way. So naturally , I tried to go for an hour barefoot today
(half was on the sidewalk / street, half on the beach) . Now I'm limping because of blisters on
my toes. The idea is that if your feet are hurting while running barefoot, you are striking
the ground too hard and in the the wrong way. Judging by how my feet feel now, I have a lot
of work relearning to do.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we set off for Cabo San Lucas.  We might stop at a few anchorages a long the way to
snorkel and wind surf, but we will probably try to get down as fast as we can.
Hopefully the winds will be good!</p>
