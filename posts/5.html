<h2>connecting a Google domain to a S3 bucket for static web hosting</h2>
<h4>Tue 07/24/18</h4>
<p>For the last year I've had this website hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, which has cost about $10 a month.
That's not too expensive,  but with S3 the cost can be almost nothing, depending on how much traffic it gets.
Very little in my case.</p>
<p>The first step is to head over to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3" title="s3">Amazon's simple storage service</a>
and create a bucket with the name of your domain. In my case, <em>nicolasknoebber.com</em> .</p>
<p><img alt="your new bucket" src="images/new_bucket.png" /></p>
<p>You can leave all the settings as their defaults. Once it's created you can start to upload all
of your files into it. For this I use the excellent AWS CLI. For this you need <code>pip</code>, and an AWS
access key. With these installed run <code>sudo pip install awscli</code> and then <code>aws configure</code>.</p>
<p>Once awscli is setup, navigate to your website directory, and run something like this:</p>
<pre><code>aws s3 sync ~/code/personal-website s3://nicolasknoebber.com --exclude="*.swp" --exclude=".git/*"
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to create an alias for this in my <code>.bashrc</code> as this command won't need to change often.</p>
<pre><code>alias sync-nk='aws s3 sync ~/code/personal-website s3://nicolasknoebber.com --exclude="*.swp" --exclude=".git/*"'
</code></pre>
<p>Now whenever you make changes, simply run this command and the bucket will be updated.</p>
<p>Once all your files are uploaded, it's time to make the bucket into a static web host.
Click the properties tab and then "Static website hosting". Enter the name of your
index document, and then save it.</p>
<p><img alt="static hosting" src="images/static_hosting.png" /></p>
<p>At this point you can click the endpoint link and see how your new site looks!</p>
<p>This isn't public yet though. To make it so that anyone can read it, head over to the permissions tab
and then bucket policy. Add this to the text area (replace nicolasknoebber with your bucket name)</p>
<pre><code>    {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                    {
                            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                            "Effect": "Allow",
                            "Principal": "*",
                            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::nicolasknoebber.com/*"
                    }
            ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Along with <em>yourdomainname.com</em> , you will also need a bucket for <em>www.yourdomainname.com</em>. Create
another bucket with the same name but prepend 'www.' to it. Go to the static web
hosting option again, but instead of 'Use this bucket to host a website', click 'Redirect all
requests'. Enter the name of your other bucket and click save.</p>
<p>Next up is configuring the DNS. Open up <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Amazon Route 53</a> and
navigate into hosted zones. Create a new hosted zone with the same name as your bucket (nicolasknoebber.com).</p>
<p>This generate a NS (name server) type row. Now Route53 needs to be told to point the traffic
towards S3. Create a record set named <code>www</code>. For the alias target add something like this</p>
<pre><code>s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
</code></pre>
<p>You may have to replace 'us-west' with a different region, look at your public endpoint URL from
S3 to be sure.</p>
<p><img alt="record set" src="images/hosted_zone.png" /></p>
<p>Now create another record set, the same as before but leave the name field empty. This makes it
so that you won't need to type 'www' in before the url.</p>
<p>The final step is to configure Google domains. Open up the DNS settings on your domain and click
'Use custom name servers'  Copy the 4 entries in the NS row from the Route53 NS row and add them here
one by one.</p>
<p><img alt="google domains" src="images/google_domains.png" /></p>
<p>And that's it! Beware that it make take a bit for URL to work. In my case it took about 10 hours.</p>
