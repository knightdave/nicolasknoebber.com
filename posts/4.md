### creating my own blogging platform
#### Thu 07/19/18
Today I've started working on creating a new blogging platform for my website.
Previously I had my blog setup with Wordpress, but I found that I wasn't using it much,
and that it provided much more than I needed.

As a minimalist, I like the idea of a barebones style platform that I can create all the features
for. It should be easy to install and mantain, which means using as little packages as possible.
Currently the features that I am aiming for are the following:

* index page for the blog where all the posts are listed in chronological order
* a way for me to easily publish a markdown file
* a commenting system
* a serverless backend: use S3, Lambda , and SimpleDB

For this post I will focus on the first two items.

The index page will be basic. The only trick here will be to have a script that finds the title
of the new post and adds a link into the index page. The new element would look something like this:
`<li><a href="posts/4.html">creating my own blogging plaform</a></li>`

This should be straightforward. All of my posts will share the same structure: the first line
will be the `##` followed by the title. The python code will look something like this:
    md     = file('3.md')
    header = md.readline()[4:-1] #slice omits the beginning hashes and trailing \n
    md.close()
    html = file('../blog.html')
    lines = html.readlines()
    for i in range(0,len(lines)) :
      if lines[i] == '</ol>\n' :
        lines[i -1] = '  <li><a href="posts/4.html">'+header+'</a></li>\n'
        break
    html.writelines(lines)
