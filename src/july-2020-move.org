#+TITLE: Moving to the West Coast - July 2020

I'm moving back to the west coast finally from the midwest.
Anna and I are planning on taking both our vehicles and moving completely out of our apartments.
Here's my list:


* [0/3] Things to Acquire
** TODO Ice Chest
We want to minimize eating out. Stocking up on a few days of food seems like a good idea.
Plus we can have fun picnics.
** TODO Walkie-talkie
For chatting on the road!
** TODO Tarp
Cover my stuff in the back of my truck
* [0/9] Things to get rid off / Sell
** TODO CRT
** TODO Small Spider Plant
I think I'm going to give this to Scott.
** TODO Vine Plant
** TODO Big Plant
** TODO Table / Chair set
** TODO Couch
** TODO Speaker set
** TODO Bed
** TODO Bathroom shelves
