Sat 07/21/18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! I'm a computer science major who is interested in a whole lot of
stuff. I grew up in Mendocino, a small town on the coast of Northern California. 
I graduated from [[https://grinnell.edu][Grinnell College]] in 2017.

On the computer science side I am currently interested in the following topics:

+ GNU/Linux
+ Web development
+ Data visualization
+ Emergent algorithms and fractals
+ Privacy
+ Decentralized networks
+ Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology

Outside of computers I enjoy long distance running, racing, writing, reading books,
and playing games.

In general I am open to most things, and try to take any idea into consideration.
So if you want to connect with me, work with me, or share any kind of idea, please email me!
